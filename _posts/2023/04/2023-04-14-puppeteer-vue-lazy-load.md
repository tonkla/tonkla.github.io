title: Solving Vue.js SPA Page Scraping Issues with Puppeteer
---

I was trying to extract data from some web pages using a tool called [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/). These pages were single-page application (SPA), created using Vue.js. Most of the pages were scraped successfully, but one important page returned no data. I spent 4 hours trying different ways to fix the issue, but I couldn't figure out why the data wasn't loading.

Today, I realized that I needed to find the root cause of the problem. I had an idea to capture a screenshot of the page to see how it was being rendered. When I did this, I noticed that the output image was too small. I realized that the default size used by Puppeteer was too small.

I eventually figured out that the problem was caused by the fact that the page was a lazy loaded component. This means that the data is only fetched when the component is shown on the screen (see [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API)). To fix this, I increased the initial screen size by adding the following parameters:

```javascript
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
  headless: true,
  args: [`--window-size=1920,1080`],
  defaultViewport: { width: 1920, height: 1080 },
});
```

By doing this, I was able to successfully extract the data from the page.
